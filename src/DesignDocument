Here we go
Need:
Scanner class, ints
Coordinate form
Parse out x and y values
toString()
Worship the ;

In LinearEquation:
Create Private Variables:
    int x1
    int x2
    int y1
    int y2
    int sx(movement of x)
    int sy(movement of y)
    int m = sy + "" + sx
    double b = however we find the y intercept
Constructor LinearEquation to take in (int, int, int, int)
Transfer inputs into the variables x1, y1, x2, y2

Method to extract the ints from the string?
Method calculateSlope to calculate the slope

Use substring?
x2-x1, y2-y1 for slope of y/x
I like failed math uhh idk what comes next
x2 = x2 mod sx, y2 = y2 mod sy?
x2 = x2 / sx, y2 = y2/ sy?
Some wacky stuff to actually get the slope done I don't know how to do it (UPDATE THIS LATER)

Method toString to call the actual values of the object wrapped in text instead of its memory location
Make it print some definitions text so it's more understandable

Initialise the Scanner Class in FrontDoor
Make public variables:
    int x1
    int x2
    int y1
    int y2
Step 1: Ask questions, fill them into the variables using scanner
Step 2: Fill in the constructor with variables

Step : Call the toString()
Step ???: Profit
