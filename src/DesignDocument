Here we go
Need:
Scanner class, ints
Coordinate form
Parse out x and y values
toString()
Worship the ;

In LinearEquation:
Create Private Variables: DONE
    int x1
    int x2
    int y1
    int y2
    int px(placeholder x) REMOVED
    int py(placeholder y) REMOVED
    int sx(movement of x)
    int sy(movement of y)
    int m = sy + "/" + sx REMOVED
    double b = however we find the y intercept REMOVED
Constructor LinearEquation to take in (int, int, int, int) DONE
Transfer inputs into the variables x1, y1, x2, y2 DONE


Method to extract the ints from the string? (returns ints from string) DONE, LOADED INTO FrontDoor
Method calculateSlope to calculate the slope (returns a double) DONE
Method intercept to calculate the y intercept (returns an int) DONE (NEED TESTING)
Method distance to calculate the distance between the 2 points (returns a double) DONE
Method yValue to calculate the y value of a point with given x value (returns a string) DONE

Use substring to extract ints from input DONE

Method toString to call the actual values of the object wrapped in text instead of its memory location DONE
Make it print some definitions text so it's more understandable DONE

Initialise the Scanner Class in FrontDoor DONE
Make public variables: DONE
    int x1
    int x2
    int y1
    int y2
Step 1: Ask questions, fill them into the variables using scanner DONE
Step 2: Fill in the constructor with variables DONE
Step 3: Call the calculate method UNNECESSARY
Step 4: Call the intercept method UNNECESSARY
Step 5: Call the toString() DONE
Step 6: Call the yValue method DONE
Step 6.5: Torture friends to try and break the code WIP
Step 7: Profit DONE
